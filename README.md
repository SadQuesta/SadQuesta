## 🚀 About Me
I'm a software developer and data enthusiast with a deep interest in building intelligent systems that understand and respond to human input — from text summarizers to voice-controlled AI agents.

My background combines:
- ⚙️ Backend development (Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL)
- 🧠 Machine Learning & AI (ANN, NLP, local LLMs like Mistral)
- 🌐 Frontend with React, Next.js & TailwindCSS
- 🧰 DevOps basics (Docker, deployment)

Currently building:
- 🧾 A smart **Text Summarizer App** using OpenAI & LM Studio
- 🎙️ A multilingual **Voice Summarizer** with diarization and translation
